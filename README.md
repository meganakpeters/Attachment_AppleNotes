# Image or PDF to Apple Notes
 Are you sick of not being able to save images, PDFs, or other attachments to Apple Notes directly from a non-Apple device? Now you can!

 Read the embedded PDF in this repo (which has screenshots) to learn how to do this yourself! Requires one Mac computer (not iOS), a cloud sync service of your choosing (Google Drive, Dropbox, etc), internet access, and the non-Apple device you want to send stuff from.
